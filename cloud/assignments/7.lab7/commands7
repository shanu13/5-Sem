**Dont install docker in EC2 space wont be sufficient, do it in your local machine
**Docker file no change, keep it as it is.


**q2,q3,Dockerfile must be in testfolder

1. Docker build D:\useful\sem 5\2.cloud computing\lab\7.lab7

command : docker images => will list the docker images.. ( take the image id which is around 4.1 GB)

2. docker run -d -it --name=pyC -v "G:\cloud\assignments\7.lab7":/shared 537dae4b323c   => this is image ID( different for different users)

3. docker exec -it pyC /bin/bash

inside container 



4. 

hadoop jar /usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-*.jar -input /shared/inputfile.txt -output /shared/q1_output3 -mapper "python3 /shared/q1/mapper.py" -reducer "python3 /shared/q1/reducer.py"

hadoop jar /usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-*.jar -input /shared/inputfile.txt -output /shared/q2_output2 -mapper "python3 /shared/q2/mapper.py" -combiner "python3 /shared/q2/combiner.py"


hadoop jar /usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-*.jar -input /shared/iris.data -output /shared/q3output -mapper "python3 /shared/q3/mapper.py" -reducer "python3 /shared/q3/reducer.py" -combiner "python3 /shared/q3/combiner.py"

** output will be in the folder /myfolder/q2Output respectively for other command, open the file ("part-00000") which is present in the  /myfolder/q2Output




to remove the image

6*. docker rmi imageID
